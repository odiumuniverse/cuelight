// EventLog.swift -- the append-only record of what the hooks saw.
//
// Session files hold only the latest event, because that is all the light needs.
// Statistics need the history, so every hook also appends one line here.
//
// One file per month: rotation for free, "last month" is one file to read, and
// throwing away old data is `rm`. Roughly 4 MB a month on a heavy day-in-day-out
// workload.
